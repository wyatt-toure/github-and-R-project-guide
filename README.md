Welcome to the GitHub directory for this starter guide on using GitHub and Rmarkdown in research. This repository hosts the materials to construct the site at: https://wyatt-toure.github.io/github-and-R-project-guide/. I wrote this as a resource I would have wanted when I was just starting out in my Msc degree with little experience in the practicalities of organizing project directories, version controlling files, or writing up analysis documentation. Note this is a work in progress as of Apr 22, 2021. 

## Directory structure

  - `docs/` contains the html rendered site pages. The GitHub pages site is
    built from this folder
  - `R/` contains R scripts to generate some figures
  - `reference-info/` contains the bibliography (.bib) and citation style (.csl)
    files
  - `images/` contains the images sourced in the website
